All files and directories in Azure Files reside in a container called a Share. 
Your storage account can have as many shares as your account capacity allows. 
To obtain access to a share and its contents, you need to use an Azure Files client.

1. The "public static final String storageConnectionString" defines which storage to work from
change the String if you want to change storage. You can find the connection String in Azure by 
Home -> Storage accounts -> [StorageName] - Access keys
